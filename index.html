            </p>
            <p>With a year of freelance web design experience, I have delivered high-quality and customized web
                solutions for clients across various industries. I have developed a keen eye for creating responsive and
                visually appealing designs that enhance user satisfaction and engagement. Some of my notable projects
                include a portfolio website for a photographer, an e-commerce website for a clothing brand, and a
                landing page for a travel agency.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence at Sindh Madressatul Islam
                University, where I am expanding my skill set and knowledge to stay at the forefront of evolving
                technologies and design trends. I am eager to apply my passion and creativity to tackle challenges and
                contribute innovative solutions in the dynamic world of web development. My goal is to leverage my web
                design expertise and AI education to create impactful and user-centric web experiences that solve
                real-world problems.</p>
